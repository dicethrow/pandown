todo: check that this demo makes sense. I've just revised the sorting approach ot make it simpler (alphabetical order of all source file paths), but it might be a breaking change for some docs, which should have their structure revised.

The headings and depth etc of `1_subfolderA`, `2_subfolderB` and `3_subfolderC` should be identical. (how to refer to headings, with internal links?)

``` parts
1_subfolderA
2_subfolderB
3_subfolderC
e_file1.md
f_file2.md
```
