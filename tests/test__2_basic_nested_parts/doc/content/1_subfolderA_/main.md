# should be heading 1 from 1_subfolderA (/main.md) 

Note here that there is not a higher level heading, this jumps immediately into a lower heading level. This looks messy! I could add a complicated way to indicate to make this heading a different level, but instead of that I recommend to use another file to put some introductory content with a higher heading level in.

## should be 1st heading 2 from 1_subfolderA (/main.md)
