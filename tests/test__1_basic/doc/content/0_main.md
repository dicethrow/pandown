# This is part one

## heading one in /main.md

Edit made on new os.

**paragraph** in /main.md

note the things in **parts** must be *directories* which contain a main.md. That main.md file may also have a **parts** section for including further files, etc.


# This is part two

## To do
- Closely match the appearance of my latex documents from a year ago
	- same border spacing
	- same structure, e.g. have an abstract/terminology/progress sections, bibliography/appendix etc
	- make top level headings as 'parts', e.g. part 1, part 2,


well let's consider this algorithm

```python
def mainko(bozo):
	return "hungry"
```


as well as this

```c
int mainko(int bozo){
	return ERROR_UNDEF;
}
```

## heading level 2 in the .md
aaa

### heading level 3 in the .md
bbb

todo - make the key:value thing in parts be section parts to filenames, e.g. for abstract, progress, etc?
``` parts
a_outerfolder
b_outerfolder
c_outerfolder
d_outerfolder
```


# another top level heading
