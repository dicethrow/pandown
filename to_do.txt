- bugs found
	- each heading/label needs to be unique.
		- e.g. if you use ## AAAAA in one part of the whole document, and # AAAAA elsewhere, this issue occurs: [7]pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier (name{AAAAA})  has been already used, duplicate ignored
	- there needs to be a newline before a dot-point list for pandown-to-html, but vscode-markdown-preview will still work - todo: handle this in pandown
	- it looks like level_offset in this parts thing effects the parent file, when it shoul only impact files named in the parts list
	- the generated_output_files functionality only runs if `parts` blocks are used in the document. Make this not so, also makt this functionality work for latex docs, not just html.

- improvement ideas
	- add a debug/drafting flag such that it is possible to print in the final document the relative path of the source file that contains the content
		- this would aid development and review of the document
		- and might even make it easier/possible to automatically allow editing in .docx/googledocs format with nested files
	- have some automatied way to parse generated content to check that the files produced by tests are correct? currently it requires manual checking

	- when images are included,
		- if the dest is a PDF/latex, then the image will be included in the final document
		- if the dest is a html, then we need to include the image with the final .html file, and have a relative link
			- all used images should be copied to `doc/generated_output_files`

					- but the second bit is; there is a path-to-pandown redundant at the start
Add tests incl. links to websites, paths to local files, paths to local files to copy, etc.
Make links between markdown files, that work in vscode, work in the final document
