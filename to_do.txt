- bugs found
	- each heading/label needs to be unique.
		- e.g. if you use ## AAAAA in one part of the whole document, and # AAAAA elsewhere, this issue occurs: [7]pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier (name{AAAAA})  has been already used, duplicate ignored
	- there needs to be a newline before a dot-point list for pandown-to-html, but vscode-markdown-preview will still work - todo: handle this in pandownj)
	- it looks like level_offset in this parts thing effects the parent file, when it shoul only impact files named in the parts list

- improvement ideas
	- add a debug/drafting flag such that it is possible to print in the final document the relative path of the source file that contains the content
		- this would aid development and review of the document
		- and might even make it easier/possible to automatically allow editing in .docx/googledocs format with nested files
