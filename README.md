# pandown

## how pandown works

- the pandown python lib is installed locally
- it is used to manage interactions with a container, which contains the pandoc program.
- 

## making documents with pandown

- the level of the heading is the heading level within the file, plus its depth in the folder tree
- links, pictures etc should be made to work using conventional markdown preview, then a pandoc filter/s should be implemented to ensure it works
- custom features can be implemented using markdown comment blocks
