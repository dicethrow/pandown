# Heading level 1 (should become 2) in content/b_outerfolder/main.md

Content below that heading in the markdown file. A nested list test follows.

1. This is one element
2. Another
	1. And a nested element
		- with a nested dot
		- another
	2. More element
3. Outer end of list

Note that there are two more subfolders here, however they are not referenced in this markdown file, and hence are not integrated into the final document.
